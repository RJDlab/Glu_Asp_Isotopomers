# Glu_Asp_Isotopomers
For natural abundance correction, the matrices were generated with "Glutamate 2020-12-17 natural abundance correction matrix v1.3.R”, "Aspartate 2021-01-06 natural abundance correction matrix v1.4.R”, “input.xlsx”, and “inputAsp.xlsx”.

For nonnegative least square regression, “Glu_correction.R” is used for natural abundance corrected glutamate isotopomer distribution, “Glu_uncorrection.R” is used for uncorrected glutamate isotopomer distribution, “Asp_correction.R” is used for natural abundance corrected aspartate isotopomer distribution, and “Asp_uncorrection.R” is used for uncorrected aspartate isotopomer distribution. The related input files are “Input Data Glu Asp.xlsx” and “Supplementary Data II.xlsx”.

For nonnegative least square regression error estimation, “error_estimation_v5.R” and “Supplementary Data II.xlsx” are used.
