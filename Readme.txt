For natural abundance correction, the matrices of glutamate and aspartate provided in “Supplementary Data II” (SD II), Table S3 and Table S5 were generated through R scripts.  The matrix of glutamate (Table S3) was generated with "Glutamate 2020-12-17 natural abundance correction matrix v1.3.R” using “input.xlsx” provided information of glutamate. The matrix of aspartate (Table S5) was generated with "Aspartate 2021-01-06 natural abundance correction matrix v1.4.R” using “inputAsp.xlsx” provided information of aspartate.
 
The isotopomer distributions are fitted through nonnegative least square regression using matrices of glutamate and aspartate provided in “Supplementary Data II” (SD II) and corresponding normalized fractions measured from LC-MS/MS. For the corrected glutamate isotopomer distribution, the calculation matrix of glutamate (SD II, Table S3) is used in conjunction with “Glu_correction.R”.  For uncorrected glutamate isotopomer distribution, the calculation matrix of glutamate (SD II, Table S4) is used in conjunction with “Glu_uncorrection.R”.  For corrected aspartate isotopomer distribution, the calculation matrix of aspartate (SD II, Table S5) is used in conjunction with “Asp_correction.R”.  For uncorrected aspartate isotopomer distribution, the calculation matrix of aspartate (SD II, Table S6) is used in conjunction with “Asp_uncorrection.R”.

For nonnegative least square regression errors, the fit results were evaluated through a survey of 32 random fractions of glutamate or 16 random fractions of aspartate using “error_estimation_v5.R” and “Supplementary Data II.xlsx”. To mimic the real distribution of glutamate, restricted 32 random fractions of glutamate were used in conjunction with “error_estimation_mimicking_real_world.R” and “Supplementary Data II.xlsx”.
